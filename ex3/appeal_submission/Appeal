My Errors:

* First, I accidently submitted an old tar in which one major problem was yet
  to be fixed. That is, I already made the change (prior to submission), and
  submitted the unchanged file ( :-( ) 
  The problem was segfault due to uninitialized ExecReduce data structures, 
  that was fixed using a simple mutex barrier to prevent the ExecReduce
  threads from running until their data structures are initialized - exactly
  the same as the ExecMap problem that was discussed in the forums.
  This is a stupid-reckless mistake that failed probably 90% of the tests.

* My second error was a tricky one. I tried to avoid a situation in which the
  shuffle blocks the ExecMaps frequently, while reading their output. 
  Therefore I used a vector of ExecMap results (for each thread) to which the
  ExecMap pushed new data. The shuffle read it from the beggining while 
  keeping track of the index it read (without locking it, since we're only
  reading and not modifying). The problem is when the shuffle tried to read
  from this vector in the same time the ExecMap pushed data to it, and this
  data adding invoked an internal vector's data reallocation, it attempted to
  access invalidated data - and that resulted in a segfault.
  Note that a simple 'realloc' wouldn't have invalidate the vector's data -
  it happened only when a full blown 'free' + 'malloc' was performed.
  This happened only when the maps pushed a huge amount of data - 
  I tested my library with big files and complex situations - and didn't
  encounter this problem. Only running the WordCount test did on very big files
  did.
  
  This was fixed using an array (vector) of mutexes for each ExecMap, which is
  locked whenever the ExecMap pushes data to the vector (and unlocked after
  that), and when the shuffle tries to access this ExecMap's data.

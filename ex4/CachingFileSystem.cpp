   ten bytes in the buff and return the number 10.
   
   In order to read a file from the disk, 
   we strongly advise you to use "pread" rather than "read".
   Pay attention, in pread the offset is valid as long it is 
   a multipication of the block size.
   More specifically, pread returns 0 for negative offset 
   and an offset after the end of the file
   (as long as the the rest of the requirements are fulfiiled).
   You are suppose to preserve this behavior also in your implementation.

 * filesystem wants to return write errors in close() and the file
 * has cached dirty data, this is a good place to write back data
 * and return any errors.  Since many applications ignore close()
 * errors this is not always useful.
 *
 * NOTE: The flush() method may be called more than once for each
 * open().  This happens if more than one file descriptor refers
 * to an opened file due to dup(), dup2() or fork() calls.  It is
 * not possible to determine if a flush is final, so each flush
 * should be treated equally.  Multiple write-flush sequences are
 * relatively rare, so this shouldn't be a problem.
 *
 * Filesystems shouldn't assume that flush will always be called
 * after some writes, or that if will be called at all.

 * with the same flags and file descriptor.  It is possible to
 * have a file opened more than once, in which case only the last
 * release will mean, that no more reads/writes will happen on the
